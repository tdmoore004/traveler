  ## User Story
  As an avid traveler, I want to be able to store all of my necessary travel information for flights, lodging and activities, so that I can focus on enjoying my travels and not have to take time to look in multiple places for any information I may need. I want to be able to add information for my flights both to and from my destination as well as any details for my lodging once I arrive as well as the activities that I am participating in; I want to have easy access to this information both before and during my trip, even if I may not have an internet connection.

  ## Challenges and Progress
  * Time constrain was one of the biggest challenges. Four of us had less than 2 weeks (besides working full time) to complete this project, from ideation to deployment and presentation. We had to cut down on features so that we could build a functional scooter rathan than an automobile that is broken. 
  * It is first time for any of us to build something of this scale, from front-end (using express-handlebars and Foundation CSS) to server (node.js express.js) to database connection (express sequelize, mysql2), along with new tools for authentication such as passport, passort-local startegy, express-session and password hashing such as bcryptjs. Any changes including the ones that improve the APP could cause unexpected bugs and hours of our time to fix the hugs.
